        p This lovely salon located in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle was in need of a website makeover. Being jointly owned by my wife and sister-in-law, they gave me the complete freedom to design and develop the new site. Since launching the site, the salon has seen a steady rise in bookings thanks to UI &amp; SEO improvement, plus Facebook integration.
