        p This lovely salon located in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle was in need of a website "makeover." Being that it is jointly owned by my wife and sister-in-law, they gave me the complete freedom to design and develop the new site. Since launching the website, the salon has seen a steady rise in bookings thanks to UI &amp; SEO improvement, plus Facebook Open Graph integration.
